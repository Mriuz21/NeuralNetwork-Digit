# Neural Network - Handwritten digit recognizer
Handwritten digit recognizer is a personal project in collaboration with Ivan Andrei (.), with the purpose of experimenting with machine learning. The program is a feed-forward neural network made from scratch, using mainly numpy.
## Training  
The NN has been trained on the MNIST dataset which consist of 28x28 images of handwritten digits.
Data augumentation was a must because The MNIST dataset has the images centered and scaled to fit in a 20x20 box
